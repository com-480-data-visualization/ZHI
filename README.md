## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

### Dataset

For this project, we will be utilizing a comprehensive football player dataset from the FIFA console game, which is available at the following link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-23-complete-player-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-23-complete-player-dataset). 

This dataset encompasses 9 years of data, ranging from FIFA 15 to FIFA 23, and is divided into six sub-datasets totaling 5GB:

- `female_coaches.csv`
- `female_players.csv`
- `female_teams.csv`
- `male_coaches.csv`
- `male_players.csv`
- `male_teams.csv`

Our primary focus is the `male_players` sub-dataset, which features detailed information on football players. It contains more than 110 attributes per player, including name, club, nationality, overall rating, specific skill statistics, and more. Across all the years covered, this dataset includes nearly 60K different players, amounting to a total of 10M entries.

Additionally, the `male_teams` complementary dataset encompasses over 1,000 different teams, documenting all the teams in the game. The team IDs in this dataset match those in the `male_players` dataset, facilitating data merging operations without any loss of information.

The main dataset, `male_players`, boasts nearly 110 attributes, but we intend to use only a dozen that are of particular interest to us. The datasets are dense, with a minimal presence of missing values for the attributes of interest, and are rich with entries. Therefore, given the data's precision and comprehensiveness, no preprocessing or cleaning is necessary. 

Although our study primarily focuses on male football players, we do not rule out the possibility of extending our findings to female players in the future. Despite the female datasets being 10 times smaller than their male counterparts, they still contain a significant amount of data.

Finally, as football enthusiasts and fans of the FIFA game, we have verified the reliability of the data on a sample basis.


### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
